=========

A Static Blog Generator written in BASH(+Python).
To get a hang of writing again, developed a normal post generator.
Uses VIM to add a post and simulataneously create HTML pages for the new post being entered as wel as add an entry along with the system date in blog.html page.
used to handle my own private <a href="http://ankitvad.github.io/blog/blog.html">blog</a>
